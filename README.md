An Arduino Uno sketch for a little robot that tracks light in fun ways.

Hector is an Arduino Uno, attached to a chinese clone of an Adafruit Motor Shield v1, who uses a pair of DC motors and a pair of passive light sensors on a very light wheeled frame in order to decide how to move.

Here is a video of Hector in action:
